plone.app.deco Installation
===========================

plone.app.deco is only tested with Plone 3.2, but should work with other
versions. To install plone.app.deco checkout the package from the plone svn
in your src directory.

plone.app.deco depends on plone.formwidget.layout and plone.behavior.layout
which can be found at https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/sandbox

Since plone.app.deco depends on Dexterity also start by using this buildout:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.dexterity/buildouts/dev

In the collective there is an example package called example.deco which
contains an example contenttype to test Deco with. It can be found here:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/example.deco

After putting all these packages in your src folder add plone.formwidget.layout,
plone.behavior.layout, plone.app.deco and example.deco to the eggs, develop and
zcml options in your buildout.cfg, followed by runing buildout and starting
the instance.

When the instance is started add a Plone Site and install plone.app.deco
and example.deco using the quickinstaller.

Now go to the site and add an "Example Deco Page". In the Layout tab add the
content of the "example.html" file which can be found in the example.deco
package in the content folder.

Next time you edit the page you should get the Deco UI, if you don't; contact me
on irc (Rob|4D)
