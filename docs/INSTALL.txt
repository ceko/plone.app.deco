experimental.deco Installation
==============================

experimental.deco is only tested with Plone 3.2, but should work with other
versions. To install experimental.deco checkout the package from the plone svn
in your src directory.

experimental.deco depends on experimental.blocks which can be found here:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/experimental.blocks/ also put this package
in src.

experimental.blocks depends on lxml 2.1.5. The easiest to install this is to
use the z3c.recipe.staticlxml recipe, this recipe can be found here:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.recipe.staticlxml/0.3

Here's an example buildout for Plone 3.2:

[buildout]
parts = 
    lxml
    pylxml
    zope2
    instance

log-level = DEBUG

download-directory = downloads
download-cache = downloads

find-links =
    http://dist.plone.org/release/3.2

extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/3.2/versions.cfg
versions = versions

develop =
    src/experimental.blocks
    src/experimental.deco

eggs =
    Plone
    experimental.blocks
    experimental.deco

[versions]
lxml = 2.1.5

[pylxml]
recipe=zc.recipe.egg
interpreter=pylxml
eggs=
    lxml

[lxml]
recipe = z3c.recipe.staticlxml
egg = lxml

[zope2]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
url = http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.10.6/Zope-2.10.6-final.tgz
fake-zope-eggs = true
additional-fake-eggs =
    ZConfig
    pytz

[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
user = admin:admin
http-address = 8080
debug-mode = off

eggs =
    ${buildout:eggs}

zcml =
    experimental.blocks
    experimental.deco


When the instance is started add a Plone site and install experimental.blocks
and experimental.deco using the quickinstaller.

Now go to the site and add an ATFile and upload the deco.html file which can be
found in the experimental.deco package in the content folder.

To view and edit the page using Deco go to:
