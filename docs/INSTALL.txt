plone.app.deco Installation
===========================

Start by using the buildout located at the following url:
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/sandbox/plone.app.deco/buildouts/dev

Run python2.4 bootstrap.py then ./bin/buildout and start the instance. When the
instance is started add a Plone Site and install the following packages using
the quickinstaller:
- Configuration registry
- Plone z3c.form support
- Dexterity Content Types
- Deco
- Example Deco content

Now go to the your Personal Preferences view and set the wysiwyg editor to
Basic HTML textarea.

Now go to the site and add an "Example Deco Page". In the Layout tab add the
content of the "example.html" file which can be found in the example.deco
package in the content folder.

Next time you edit the page you should get the Deco UI, if you don't; contact me
on irc (Rob|4D)
