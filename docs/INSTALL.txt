plone.app.deco Installation
===========================

Start by using the buildout located at the following url:
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/sandbox/plone.app.deco/buildouts/dev

Then do the following:
- run python2.6 bootstrap.py
- run ./bin/buildout
- Start the instance, create a new site
- Install the "Page" product using the Quickinstaller or Control Panel
- Go to the front page of the site and add an "Page" (there are two at the
  moment, 1 old and 1 new, make sure you use the ++add++plone.page, check your
  statusbar)

You can also install example.deco for some extra example tiles.

Since the labels for the field tiles are always at the left at the moment they
won't be visible for the leftmost tiles. If this bothers you, uncomment the
section that gives you a fixed-width layout in ploneCustom.css (in Sunburst)
