plone.app.deco Installation
===========================

plone.app.deco is only tested with Plone 3.2, but should work with other
versions.

Since plone.app.deco depends on Dexterity start by using this buildout:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.dexterity/buildouts/dev
Extend the buildout with the following buildout:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/sandbox/plone.app.deco/buildouts/deco.cfg

Checkout plone.app.deco, plone.formwidget.layout and plone.behavior.layout
in your src folder which can be found at https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/sandbox

In the collective there is an example package called example.deco which
contains an example contenttype to test Deco with. It can be found here:
http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/example.deco

Also checkout plone.registry, plone.app.registry and plone.tiles from
http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone into your src folder.

After putting all these packages in your src folder add plone.formwidget.layout,
plone.behavior.layout, plone.app.deco, example.deco, plone.registry,
plone.app.registry and plone.tiles to the eggs, develop and zcml options in your
buildout.cfg, followed by running ./bin/buildout -c deco.cfg and starting the
instance.

When the instance is started add a Plone Site and install all the Deco,
Dexterity and Configuration registry packages using the quickinstaller.

Now go to the your Personal Preferences view and set the wysiwyg editor to
Basic HTML textarea.

Now go to the site and add an "Example Deco Page". In the Layout tab add the
content of the "example.html" file which can be found in the example.deco
package in the content folder.

Next time you edit the page you should get the Deco UI, if you don't; contact me
on irc (Rob|4D)
